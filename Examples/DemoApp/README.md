# Demo App Instructions

This directory contains a sample app demonstrating the usage of the SubscriptionExample package.

## Running the Demo App

### Option 1: Using Xcode (Recommended)
1. Open the DemoApp directory in Xcode:
   ```
   open -a Xcode /path/to/subscription-example-for-ios/Examples/DemoApp
   ```
2. Select a simulator device from the scheme dropdown
3. Click Run or press Cmd+R

### Option 2: Using Swift Package Manager
```bash
cd /path/to/subscription-example-for-ios/Examples/DemoApp
swift run
```

## Using SwiftUI Previews

The files contain special Xcode configuration comments that enable previews to work even without a full Xcode project:

```swift
// xcode: target=DemoApp
// xcode: platform=iOS
// xcode: deployment_target=16.0
```

## Troubleshooting SwiftUI Previews

If you see the error "Active scheme does not build this file":

1. **Important**: Double-click the `DemoApp.xcodeproj` file to open it in Xcode directly
2. Run the included script to generate Xcode schemes:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Examples/DemoApp
   ./generate_preview_schemes.sh
   ```
3. Make sure the active scheme is set to "DemoApp" (not "SubscriptionExample")
4. Clean the build folder (Product â†’ Clean Build Folder)
5. Close and reopen the file you want to preview
6. Try using the `PreviewHelper.swift` file which contains working preview configurations

Advanced troubleshooting:
1. Create a new scheme specifically for the DemoApp target in Xcode
2. Make sure all dependencies have been resolved
3. Open in a new Xcode window rather than as part of the package workspace
